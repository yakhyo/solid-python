**The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** is a design principle that is part of the SOLID acronym for object-oriented
programming. It states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have
only one responsibility, and that responsibility should be encapsulated within that class.

The SRP aims to make code more modular, reusable, and maintainable. By separating responsibilities into separate classes
or modules, we can isolate changes to a particular functionality without affecting other parts of the codebase. This
makes it easier to test and refactor code.
